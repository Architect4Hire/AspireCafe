# AspireCafe: A Modern Cloud-Native Architecture with .NET 9

The AspireCafe solution demonstrates a modern approach to building distributed, cloud-native applications using .NET 9 and the .NET Aspire application stack. This blog post explores the architecture, components, and design patterns that make this solution scalable, maintainable, and future-proof.

---

## **Architecture Overview**

AspireCafe is a **microservices-based architecture** designed to manage various aspects of a cafe's operations. Each microservice is independently deployable and responsible for a specific domain, ensuring modularity and scalability.

### **Core Microservices**

1. **Product API**: Manages the product catalog and inventory.
2. **Counter API**: Handles order creation, payment processing, and order state management.
3. **Kitchen API**: Manages food preparation workflows.
4. **Barista API**: Handles beverage preparation workflows.
5. **Order Summary API**: Aggregates and summarizes order data for reporting and analytics.

### **Frontend**

The **AspireCafe.UI** project is an Angular-based single-page application (SPA) that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the backend services. It is containerized and integrated into the overall solution using the `.WithNpmApp()` method in the application host.

---

## **Key Technical Components**

### **.NET Aspire Application Host**

The solution uses two application host projects for managing service orchestration and infrastructure:

1. **Aspirecafe.Intel64**:
   - Configures local development with emulators for Azure services.
   - Provides a seamless development experience with consistent dependencies.

2. **Aspirecafe.Azure**:
   - Configures production-ready services using Azure connection strings.
   - Ensures secure and scalable deployment in the cloud.

3. **Aspirecafe.AMD64**:
   - Configures local development with emulators for Azure services for AMD chipsets (Mac Silicon).
   - Provides a seamless development experience with consistent dependencies.

### **Cloud-Native Infrastructure**

The solution integrates with several Azure services for robust infrastructure:

- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Document database for storing product and order data.
- **Redis Cache**: Distributed caching for performance optimization.
- **Azure Service Bus**: Message broker for asynchronous communication between services.
- **Azure Key Vault**: Secure storage for credentials and configuration.

These services are containerized for local development, ensuring consistency across environments.

---

## **Design Patterns and Practices**

### **1. Layered Architecture**

Each microservice follows a clean, layered architecture:

- **API Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses (e.g., `CounterController`).
- **Facade Layer**: Orchestrates business logic and validation (e.g., `Facade.cs`).
- **Business Layer**: Implements core business rules (e.g., `IBusiness`).
- **Data Layer**: Manages data access and persistence (e.g., `IData`).

This separation of concerns ensures maintainability and testability.

---

### **2. Dependency Injection**

The solution uses dependency injection extensively to decouple components:


```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<IFacade, Facade>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IBusiness, Business>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IData, Data>();

```

This approach enhances modularity and makes the system easier to test.

---

### **3. Façade Pattern**

The Façade pattern simplifies the interaction between the API layer and the business logic:


```csharp
public class Facade : IFacade
{
    private readonly IBusiness _business;
    private readonly OrderViewModelValidator _validator;

    public async Task<Result<OrderServiceModel>> SubmitOrderAsync(OrderViewModel order)
    {
        var validationResult = await _validator.ValidateAsync(order);
        if (!validationResult.IsValid)
        {
            return Result<OrderServiceModel>.Failure(Error.InvalidInput, validationResult.Errors.Select(x => x.ErrorMessage).ToList());
        }
        return Result<OrderServiceModel>.Success(await _business.SubmitOrderAsync(order));
    }
}

```

This pattern abstracts complex business logic and validation, providing a clean interface to the API layer.

---

### **4. Result Pattern**

A custom `Result<T>` type is used for consistent error handling:


```csharp
public class Result<T> where T : ServiceBaseModel
{
    public bool IsSuccess { get; }
    public bool IsFailure => !IsSuccess;
    public List<string> Messages { get; set; }
    public Error Error { get; }
    public T? Data { get; set; }

    public static Result<T> Success(T data) => new(true, Error.None, null, data);
    public static Result<T> Failure(Error error, List<string>? messages) => new(false, error, messages, null);
}

```

This approach avoids exception-based flow control and provides clear error information.

---

### **5. Validation Pattern**

The solution uses **FluentValidation** for input validation:


```csharp
var validationResult = await _validator.ValidateAsync(product);
if (!validationResult.IsValid)
{
    return Result<ProductServiceModel>.Failure(Error.InvalidInput, validationResult.Errors.Select(x => x.ErrorMessage).ToList());
}

```

This ensures robust input validation before business operations.

---

### **6. API Documentation**

Controllers use XML comments and `ProducesResponseType` attributes to generate comprehensive API documentation:


```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Creates a new product.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="product">The product details to be created.</param>
/// <returns>A <see cref="Result{T}"/> containing the created product.</returns>
[HttpPost("create")]
[ProducesResponseType(typeof(Result<ProductServiceModel>), 201)]

```

This integrates seamlessly with OpenAPI and Scalar.net for self-documenting APIs.

---

### **7. Frontend Integration**

The Angular-based frontend is integrated into the solution using `.WithNpmApp()`:


```csharp
var angular = builder.AddNpmApp("aspirecafe-ui", "../AspireCafe.UI/")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(env: "PORT")
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
    .PublishAsDockerFile();

```

This ensures the frontend is containerized and deployable alongside the backend services.

---

## **Modern C# and .NET Features**

The solution leverages the latest features of C# 13 and .NET 9:

- **Async/await** for non-blocking operations.
- **Pattern matching** for functional-style error handling.
- **Extension methods** for cleaner code organization.
- **Middleware** for cross-cutting concerns like exception handling.

---

## **Conclusion**

The AspireCafe solution is a prime example of how modern .NET applications can be built using a microservices architecture. By leveraging .NET Aspire, clean design patterns, and cloud-native infrastructure, the solution achieves scalability, maintainability, and ease of deployment.
